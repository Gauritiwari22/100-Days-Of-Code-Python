# Snake Game 

This is a classic Snake Game built using Python's `turtle` graphics module.  
The project is structured using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and is divided into multiple files for better readability and maintenance.

---

## Game Features

- Snake movement using arrow keys
- Food appears at random positions
- Snake grows longer when it eats food
- Score updates in real time
- Game ends when:
  - The snake hits the wall
  - The snake collides with itself

---

## Project Structure

- `Project20.py` → Main game loop and screen setup  
- `snake.py` → Snake movement, growth, and direction logic  
- `food.py` → Food generation and repositioning  
- `scoreboard.py` → Score display and game over message  

---

## Concepts Used

- Object-Oriented Programming (classes & objects)
- Inheritance
- Event listeners (`onkey`)
- Collision detection
- Game loops and screen updates

---

## Notes

This project was built as part of learning Python and OOP concepts.  
Some parts required guidance and debugging support at many places, which helped in better understanding game logic and structure.

---

## Possible Improvements

- Restart game functionality
- Difficulty levels (speed increase)
- High score saving
- Better UI design

Enjoy the game!
