# Python Coffee Machine Project

## Project Overview
This is a command-line based Coffee Machine simulation built using Python.  
The program simulates the working of a real coffee machine where users can select drinks, insert coins, receive change, and the machine manages its resources and profit.

This project was created as part of a beginner-level Python learning journey.

## Features
- Menu with drinks: espresso, latte, cappuccino
- Resource management (water, milk, coffee)
- Coin-based payment system
- Transaction validation and change calculation
- Profit tracking
- Machine status report
- Option to turn off the machine

---

## Concepts Used
- Dictionaries and nested dictionaries
- Functions and return statements
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Logical flow control
- Breaking a large problem into smaller functions

## Important Note (Honest Acknowledgement)
This project required **a lot of external guidance and help** to complete.

As a beginner, understanding:
- how to structure the program,
- how to decide when to stop or continue execution,
- how and when to use functions with return values,

was challenging.  
With step-by-step conceptual explanations and debugging help, the final working version was achieved.

The main goal of this project was **learning and understanding the logic**, not writing everything independently.

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Run the Python file in a terminal or IDE.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to order coffee, insert coins, or view reports.

## Conclusion
This project represents a learning milestone in my Python journey.  
It reflects practice, gradual improvement, and better understanding of Python fundamentals.
